                <h1>Ana Laura Flores</h1>
                <p>
                Ana lives in Guanajuato, Mexico and she is 19 years old. Ana's birthday is on October 19. I chose this incredible young lady because she is dedicated and a hard-working woman.
                She is from the same little community as me. In Mexico is really expensive to go to school and is hard for women to attend high school or college, because of gender discrimination. In her family, nobody had the chance to go to high school or college. However, technology is changing the way we get educated to a whole other level.</p>
                <p>The University of Guanajuato launched the project “The Virtual University of Guanajuato”. Thanks to the technology, thousands of students with low income and far away from big cities are able to attend high school and college. Ana Laura is one of them.
                She paid her own college by working for a company called Mary Kay. She walked long distances to sell beauty products so this way she pays for her classes. She finished her last classes in spring and now she is looking forward to her graduation ceremony.</p>
                At the same time, Ana got promoted by Mary Kay to what is called a “Directora Mary Kay”. Now, she is her own boss, and she is working with people like her selling Mary Kay products. She exited, this job takes dedication and time, but she has a lot of plans for the future.
